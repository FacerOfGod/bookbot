# ðŸ“š Welcome to Bookbot
Hey, people !! FacerOfGod here :D 

This is a Python program that analyzes novels and prints a statistical report of the word and character usage found within (project idea comes from [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/)). I want to develop this further with eventually fully functional UI, but it is going to take some time because I am still improving my skills. I will show my goals steps by step hoping not to suffer too much

## ðŸš€ 1st Project Goals
- Configure a professional Python development environment on your local machine
- Practice building a full project from scratch
- Deploy a Python project to your personal GitHub account

---
## Quick Demo

Run the program on a sample book:

```bash
python3 main.py books/mobydick.txt
```
Example output:

```

## ðŸš€ 2nd Project Goals
- Create a UI where you can simply drag and drop files
- Have visual represation of the number of characters on a chart
- Deploy the program on a website
