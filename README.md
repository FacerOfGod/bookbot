# ðŸ“š Welcome to Bookbot
Hey, people !! _FacerOfGod_ here :D 

This is a Python program that analyzes novels and prints a statistical report of the word and character usage found within (project idea comes from [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/)). I want to develop this further with eventually fully functional GUI, but it is going to take some time because I am still improving my skills. I will show my goals steps by step hoping not to suffer too much.

## ðŸš€ 1st Project Goals
- [X] Configure a professional Python development environment on your local machine
- [X] Practice building a full project from scratch
- [X] Deploy a Python project to your personal GitHub account

### How it went:
This part was relatively straightforward. I only ran into some minor issues with using Git again and a few problems setting up my Python environment, but overall, it went smoothly. I am so motivated to start this small project !

## Quick Demo

Run the program on a sample book:

```bash
python3 main.py books/mobydick.txt
```
**âš  UPDATED:** due to a few changes caused by the project expansion you must use the key word `cli`

```bash
python3 main.py cli books/mobydick.txt
```
Example output:

```

## ðŸš€ 2nd Project Goals
- [X] Create a GUI where you can simply drag and drop files
- [X] Have visual represation of the number of characters on a chart
- [ ] Allow analyse of various documents other than .txt
- [ ] Ideally handle all times of errors
- [ ] User flow test

### How it went:

- #### Project Structure
This part of the project has been quite challenging since Iâ€™ve never built a GUI in Python before. I chose to work with **PySide6** and **Matplotlib** to tackle it. Along the way, I realized that my initial file structure wasnâ€™t well-designed â€” I had lumped the GUI logic, styles, and controllers all into a single `.py` file. This made the code hard to read and even harder to scale.

To fix this, I restructured the project by separating the GUI components, styling, and logic into distinct modules. I took inspiration from my past **Kotlin group project**, where we followed a similar structure, and applying that same pattern here has made the codebase much cleaner and easier to manage.

- #### GUI
Building the GUI was fun... until it came to placing the buttons. Lining things up the way I wantedâ€”especially the Delete buttonâ€”was trickier than expected. It took way more tweaking than it probably shouldâ€™ve to get it looking right. Layout managers can be a bit of a headache, but after some trial and error (and maybe a few frustrated sighs), everything ended up more or less where it should be. Still room to improve, but it works!

- #### Support of various documents
Supporting file types beyond .txt turned out to be more complicated than I expected. Each format has its own quirksâ€”whether it's encoding, hidden characters, or just how the data is structured. I started looking into handling .pdf and .docx, but quickly realized that parsing them properly would need extra libraries and a lot more logic to handle edge cases.

## ðŸš€ 3th Project Goals
- [ ] Allow user to input text throught GUI
- [ ] Scrap off Wikipedia what the user wants to text
- [ ] Keep all the previous goals functional

## ðŸš€ 4th Project Goals
**âš  Still figuring this part out...**

This phase hasnâ€™t fully kicked off yet. The plan is probably to create an API or add some sort of backend logicâ€”still thinking it through. Once the core features are solid, Iâ€™ll circle back and explore where to go next. Could be a local API, cloud integration, or something totally different. Weâ€™ll see!
